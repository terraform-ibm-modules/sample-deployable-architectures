## Deployable Architectures

The [deployable architectures](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-understand-module-da) are a preconfigured set of infrastructure as code (IaC) assets for deploying a architectural pattern that combines one or more cloud resources that is designed for easy deployment, scalability, and modularity.

You can deploy this architecture that uses various ways of configurations and thus can be employed for various use-cases. The following table outlines these Variations and use-cases they can suffice.

|Type of variation | Best suited for |
|---------------|-------|
|QuickStart (Basic and simple)|Ideal for rapid deployment for demonstration and development purposes without extensive configuration. It creates a fully customizable Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment in a single region.|
|Fully configurable (Integrated setup with configurable services)|Ideal for users who seek flexibility to provide a dependable foundation. It grants complete control over architecture parameters, featuring optimized defaults that facilitate a fully functional Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment along with seamless integration of IBM Cloud services, eliminating the need for manual configuration.|
|Security enforced |Ideal for production workloads. It adheres to financial services compliance standards. It offers a validated configuration, which is designed to align with the IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services, to help ensure all necessary regulatory requirements are met.|
